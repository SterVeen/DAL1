\page dal_file_types DAL :: Supported file types

Officially, the DAL supports three file types: \ref dal_hdf5, \ref dal_casa_tables
and \ref dal_fits. At present, each of these file types have varying levels of support.

\section dal_hdf5 HDF5

Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5), is a relatively recent format
designed with particular attention to efficient operation on extremely large
data sets.  HDF5 is the intended format for LOFAR data products.  The reasons
for this decision are given in "Proposed Data Formats"

HDF5 is organized much like a unix file system.  The internal structure consists
of a root group, '/', which may recursively contain subgroups.  Each of these
groups may, in turn, contain other groups or n-dimensional arrays of simple or
complex datatypes.  HDF5 tables are particular case of a HDF5 array and thus are
treated in a similar manner.  Almost all objects in a HDF5 file can hold
associated metadata in the form of an attribute.  For an abbreviated list of
HDF5 features see "HDF5 vs. CASA Tables".  For a complete
list see the hdfgroup website.

HDF5 files can be both read and written by the DAL.

\section dal_casa_tables CASA Tables

CASA Tables in general, and Measurement Sets in particular, are the primary data
product of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT).  As WSRT is also
based at ASTRON (where there is a large community of experienced CASA users),
there is naturally a strong interest and advantage in building upon this
expertise for LOFAR.

CASA tables can currently be read, but not written, by the DAL.

\section dal_fits FITS

FITS is the standard astronomical image format.  Among its advantages for
inclusion in the DAL is its widespread use and extensive toolset.  Among its
limitations is the fact that it was not designed for large and complex datasets.

FITS is the lowest of priority of the three supported formats and currently has
almost no actual support in the DAL.
