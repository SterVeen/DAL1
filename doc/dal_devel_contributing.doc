  \page dal_devel_contributing Contributing changes

  Direct write access to the project's code respository is limited to a small core
  team, responsible for the guiding the development of the DAL. If you are in more
  than simply using the DAL, but actively contributing to it development, the 
  advised work-flow is as follows:

  <ol>
    <li>Create your own fork from the master repository of the project.

    <li>Work on push changes you are working on - be it bug fixes or feature 
    enhancements - back to your fork.

    <li>When ready to have your changes integrated into the project's development
     master branch, issue a pull request. This will give the core team a chance 
     to have a look at your contribution, before merging it into the master
     branch. If everything is just fine, the pull request will be requested right
     away, otherwise a short conversation might be necessary of how to go about
     the integration of your code contribution.
  </ol>
