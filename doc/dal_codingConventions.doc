  \page dal_devel_conventions Coding conventions

  No formal coding guidelines have been set up for the development of the DAL,
  though a few reasonable conventions should be adhered to in order to keep the 
  code readable and consistent:

  <ol>
    <li>All classes reside within the namespace "DAL".

    <li>All source files contain a Doxygen-based documentation of their methods.
    All classes/files are contained within the group "DAL".

    <li>Private variables are indicated by the prefix "its", in order to distringuish
    them from temporary/local variables, e.g.
    \code
    \param itsLength - private data member
    \param length    - local variable or function parameter
    \endcode
    <li>Pointers should be marked by a trailing "_p"; e.g. a dynamically allocated
    array of "data" would become  "itsData_p".
  </ol>
