  \section dal_icd_001 TBB Time-Series Data (LOFAR-USG-ICD-001)

  This document describes the internal structure of and the interface to the
  LOFAR time series data. Time series data – i.e. the digitized voltage output,
  as received by the individual LOFAR dipoles – represent the primary input
  data to the UHECR (Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays) analysis pipeline(s) and
  have to be considered as the most basic form in which the received radio
  signals are present within the LOFAR system.

  \section dal_icd_002 Representations of World Coordinates (LOFAR-USG-ICD-002)

  This document sets forth a formal data interface specification for LOFAR
  data products. The specification applies to data structures produced by
  various LOFAR processing pipelines that will be called Coordinates Group.
  This is a specification for Coordinates group data products only and in no
  way implies, and should not be inferred as, a specification for any data
  structures the project may use during in situ processing by way of producing
  a final standard Coordinates Group.

  \section dal_icd_003 Beam-Formed Data (LOFAR-USG-ICD-003)

  This document sets forth a formal data interface specification for LOFAR
  beam-formed data products. The specification applies to data structures
  produced by various LOFAR processing pipelines that will be called LOFAR
  Beam-Formed (BF) data.

  LOFAR beams can be formed where signals from antennae and/or stations are
  coherently added to form sets of smaller beams, each generating a time-series
  voltage sum. Alternatively, beams can also be incoherently added to create
  total intensities. Beamforming at the station level is required to reduce the
  raw digitized data rate per station from 0.5 Tb/s to approximately 3.1 Gb/s.

  \section dal_icd_006 Dynamic Spectrum Data (LOFAR-USG-ICD-006)

  This interface control document (ICD) describes the data format for LOFAR
  dynamic spectrum data. It was derived from the ICDs describing Beam-Formed
  Data (ICD-003) and Sky Images (ICD-004).

  A LOFAR Dynamic Spectrum Data file will be the data hosting structure for
  dynamic spectrum data produced by LOFAR, irrespective of their scientific
  purpose. It is one of the tasks of the LOFAR project to define and describe
  the structure of the LOFAR Dynamic Spectrum Data file format.
