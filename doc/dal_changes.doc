\section dal_changes_build Configuration & Build

<ol>
  <li>I've been unable to make a clean build of the DAL. Not only on the (somewhat misconfigured) machines in
  Nijmegen, but also not on a clean SUSE 10.3. To me it seems to be connected to using a newer  version of boost.
  If boost 1.33 from the system is used, I get error messeages during compilation, if I (try to) force it to use
  the boost from the  "usg/external" tree or a freshly installed boost 1.36, then I get errors during  linking. (If
  you want the exact error messages, mail me.) -- A. Horneffer (01/10/2008)
  <li>Incomplete build on kuzmin:
  \verbatim
  -- [DAL] Unable to generate Python bindings; missing Boost++ headers!
  -- [DAL] Unable to generate Python bindings; missing Python headers!
  -- [DAL] Unable to generate Python bindings; missing NumPy headers!
  -- [DAL] Unable to generate Python bindings; missing num_util headers!
  -- [DAL] Missing Boost header files!
  -- [DAL] HDF5 installation incomplete: missing H5LT.h
  -- [DAL] MYSQL installation incomplete!
  -- [DAL] GSL installation incomplete!
  \endverbatim
  Already the build of the Boost libraries from the provided sources fails. The
  question also is, if there actually is a development version of Python
  installed, because judging by the error messages during the configuration
  step, this might as well not be the case.
</ol>

\section dal_changes_testing Testing of library components and tools

- The various Python data inspection scripts need to be added to the list of \e
ctest driven tests such that we can track errors there as well.
- We need a commonly availabe set of input data files for the test programs,
such that we can run the same set of tests on the various platforms. Suggested
solution is to create tar-ball containing a collection of such datasets, which
then can be obtained from the \e download area on the USG server.

- Need test FITS dataset.

\section dal_changes_cpp Issues with the C++ interface

- Make sure all classes provide at least a basic <tt>summary()</tt> method to display the status
  of internal parameters.

- DAL::BeamFormed
  - add method to retrieve ADC sample frequency

- DAL::BeamGroup
  - get* methods don't raise Exceptions, only return default arrays
  - Add method(s) to retrieve all channels of a correlation product (Intensity,
  X, Y, etc.)
  - add methods supporting std::vector and casa::Vector
  - method to retrieve all entries for a subband fails (segfault)

- DAL::BeamSubband
  - currently has no methods to actually create a valid object connected to the
  subband table data within the dataset.
  - is there really a need to store fileID and groupID? All we actually need is
  the tableID.

- DAL::dalTable
  - need additional constructor to create table using group ID (in which the
  table is contained) and table name. -> basic implementation is done, final
  testing of internal initialization pending
  - Add methods to retrieve length of data columns
  - add opional parameter to control potential overwriting of existing table
  - rename getName() to printName(), since the current name of the method is 
  misleading.

- DAL::TBB_Timeseries
  - DAL::TBB_Timeseries::channelNames () not yet implemented - currently there is
  only an empty function as placeholder to avoid linking errors.

- DAL::TBB_StationGroup
  - DAL::TBB_StationGroup::channelNames() currently only implemented for
  std::vector<std::string> -> need to implement casa::Vector<casa::String>
  variant as well
  - Collect start-times of the dumps from the individual dipoles and thereof compute a
  relative shift between the data channels.

- DAL::TBB
  - We need to implement a frame buffer, which can be used to reorder incoming
  frames if necessary; even though raw frames may be arriving in chronological
  order for most of the time, this by no means is a globally valid assumption.
  Check whether or not some of the ideas implemented in tbbctlResort.cc can be
  used.

\section dal_changes_python Issues with the Python interface

<ol>
  <li>The <tt>POL_RESPONSE</tt> column of the <tt>FEED(1,2)</tt> table gives the
  following error when its data is accessed:
  \verbatim
   ERROR: Slicer error:length<0
  i.e.
  > from pydal import *
  > ds = dalDataset()
  > ds.open('data/lofar/cs1/L2007_01810_SB18-20_OB20.MS')
  0
  > feed1 = ds.openTable('FEED1')
  > pr = feed1.getColumn('POL_RESPONSE')
  > pr.shape()
  ([16, 2, 2],)
  > pr_data = pr.data()
  ERROR: Slicer error:length<0
  \endverbatim
  Also...
  \verbatim
  > pr_data = pr.data(1)
  ERROR: ArrayBase::validateConformance
  \endverbatim
  
  <li>If we open a table, for example \verb|OBSERVATION|, then DAL crashes when
  we access the \verb|LOG| column.
  \verbatim
  ERROR: Table DataManager error: Invalid
  operation: SSMIndStringColumn::getShape: no array in row 0
  \endverbatim

  <li>Some methods are not implemented, like \verb|readRows()| of a table.
  \verbatim
  Operation not yet supported for type MSCASA.  Sorry.
  \endverbatim

  <li>Unable to retrieve attribute <tt>MS_VERSION</tt> from MeasurementSet:
  \verbatim
  > main.getColumn('MS_VERSION')
  ERROR: Table column MS_VERSION is unknown
  > main.getAttribute('MS_VERSION')
  Operation not yet supported for type MSCASA.  Sorry.
  > main.getAttributes()
  Operation not yet supported for type MSCASA.  Sorry.
  \endverbatim

  <li>The following methods work, but may have unexpected or unusual behavior:
    - bandwidth
    - beams
    - breaks
    - datatype
    - dispersion_measure
    - emband
    - epoch_date
    - epoch_utc
    - getBeam
    - DAL::BeamGroup.ra
    - DAL::BeamGroup.dec
    - DAL::BeamGroup.n_subbands
    - DAL::BeamGroup.summary
    - DAL::BeamFormed.main_beam_diam
    - DAL::BeamFormed.notes
    - DAL::BeamFormed.nofStations
    - number_of_*
    - observation_id
    - observer, point_*
    - proj_id
    - sampling_time
    - source
    - sub_beam_diameter
    - telescope
    - weather_*
</ol>

\section dal_changes_tools Issues with the application executables

- Consider switching all command line parameter handling to Boost \e
  program_options interface; a first implementation example can be found in
  tbb2h5.cpp
  - bf2h5.cpp

<hr>

\section dal_changes_documentation Documentation

- change name of source file: dal_file_formats.doc -> dal_data_formats.doc
