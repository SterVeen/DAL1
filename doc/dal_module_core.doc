  \brief Core classes of the Data Access Library

  <ul>
    <li>\ref dal_primary_classes
  </ul>

  The DAL is designed, generally, around a superset of the features of the
  underlying formats. CASA supports a set of hierarchical tables, arrays and
  attributes. FITS supports multiple tables or arrays and associated keywords.
  HDF5 supports all of the above, including groups, as well as metadata in the
  form of attributes.

  <ul>
    <li>\b DAL::dalDataset <br>
    At the highest level, a LOFAR data product is represented by the dalDataset
    object. A dalDataset may contain any number of dalGroup, dalTable and dalArray
    objects. A dalDataset represents the file as a whole and may have associated
    metadata.
  
    <li>\b DAL::dalGroup <br>
  At the moment, the group object within the DAL is unique to HDF5. A group may
  contain sub\-groups, arrays or tables. Additionally, attributes can be attached
  to a group object.
  
    <li>\b DAL::dalTable <br>
    DAL tables can be located at the root level of a file, or within a group. A
    dalTable consits of dalColumn objects and may have associated attributes.
  
    <li>\b DAL::dalColumn <br>
    DAL columns are the components of the dalTable object. The dalData object holds
    the actual data of each column.
  
    <li>\b DAL::dalArray <br>
    DAL arrays can be located at the root level of a file, or within a group. A
    dalArray may have attribute data.

    <li>\b DAL::dalData <br>
    The dalData object holds the actual data from a dalColumn. This allows the
    column information to be stored seperately from the information about the layout
    of the data.
  
    <li>\b DAL::dalFilter <br>
    The filter object can be applied to CASA tables before opening. In the future,
    the same syntax may become available for HDF5 and FITS.
  </ul>
