  \section dal_intro Introduction

  \subsection dal_nextgen Next-generation astronomical data

The size and complexity of astronomical data are growing at relentless rates.
This increase is especially apparent in the radio community as evidenced by the 
data challenges faced by many of the SKA pathfinders and other major radio
telescopes such as <a href="http://www.lofar.org">LOFAR</a>,
<a href="http://science.nrao.edu/evla">EVLA</a>,
<a href="http://science.nrao.edu/alma">ALMA</a>, ASKAP, MeerKAT, MWA, LWA and eMERLIN.
Enormous data rates are also becoming a challenge for large optical projects
that are currently ramping up including
<a href="http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu">Pan-Starrs</a> and
<a href="http://www.lsst.org">LSST</a>. As progress towards
meeting these challenges, ASTRON and the LOFAR project are currently exploring
the use of the Hierarchical Data Format, version 5 (HDF5) for LOFAR radio data
encapsulation.

The LOFAR (<a href="http://www.lofar.org">www.lofar.org</a>) project has set up a
moderated majordomo email list, called "nextgen-astrodata@astron.nl". Interested
parties are encouraged to sign up via majordomo@anstron.nl with
"subscribe nextgen-astrodata" as the only text in the body of the message.

We would like to bring together scientists and developers struggling with large
and complex datasets as well as those groups currently exploring HDF5
(<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org">www.hdfgroup.org</a>)
implementations. Ultimately we would like to see these formats grow into a true
set of standards for radio data that can meet the demands of the next generation
of radio observatories as well as the non-radio community such as LSST and other
future missions. We feel that the time is ripe to solve this issue across
wavelengths and projects.  HDF5 is mature and is being used extensively in
science, and now as the format for the LOFAR data products.

\subsection dal_overview DAL overview

The Data Access Library (DAL) is a library that abstracts the underlying file
format from the user when working with radio astronomy data. Underlying formats
may include HDF5, AIPS++/CASA tables, FITS or specific raw formats. This library
is available to both the C/C++ developer and the Python user via the "pydal"
module.

Officially, the DAL supports three file types:

<ol>
  <li>HDF5 <br>
   Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 (HDF5), is a relatively recent format
   designed with particular attention to efficient operation on extremely large
   data sets.  HDF5 is the intended format for LOFAR data products.
   HDF5 is organized much like a unix file system.  The internal structure consists
   of a root group, '/', which may recursively contain subgroups.  Each of these
   groups may, in turn, contain other groups or n-dimensional arrays of simple or
   complex datatypes.  HDF5 tables are particular case of a HDF5 array and thus are
   treated in a similar manner.  Almost all objects in a HDF5 file can hold
   associated metadata in the form of an attribute.
   HDF5 files can be both read and written by the DAL.

  <li>CASA Tables <br>
   CASA Tables in general, and Measurement Sets in particular, are the primary data
   product of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT).  As WSRT is also
   based at ASTRON (where there is a large community of experienced CASA users),
   there is naturally a strong interest and advantage in building upon this
   expertise for LOFAR. <br>
   CASA tables can currently be read, but not written, by the DAL.

  <li>FITS <br>
   FITS is the standard astronomical image format.  Among its advantages for
   inclusion in the DAL is its widespread use and extensive toolset.  Among its
   limitations is the fact that it was not designed for large and complex
   datasets. <br>
   FITS is the lowest of priority of the three supported formats and currently
   has almost no actual support in the DAL.
</ol>

At present, each of these file types have varying levels of support.
