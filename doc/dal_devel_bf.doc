  \section dal_devel_bf_icd Data format specification

  The formal specification of the data format can be found in \ref dal_icd_003;
  the document defines the hierarchical structure -- consisting of a number of
  nested groups (much like directories on a UNIX-type system) with metadata 
  attached -- meant to match the layout of the data processing.

  \section dal_devel_bf_structure Creation of the file structure

  The classes representing the individual elements of the hierarchical structure
  are set up such, that recursive creation of structure elements is possible.
  The figure below displays the various elements of the file structure, along
  with the classes of the DAL representing these building blocks:

  \verbatim
  `-- Root group                                  BF_RootGroup
      |-- System log                              
      `-- Primary array pointing group            BF_SubArrayPointing
          `-- Beam group                          BF_BeamGroup
              `-- Stokes dataset                  BF_StokesDataset
  \endverbatim

  In order to allow for the recursive creation of the above structure, the
  individual classes permit the creation of structures at hierarchical levels
  below.
